## Why is the King of the seven kingdoms referred to as King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men.?


The king of the seven kingdoms is referred as:

- **XYZ of house ABC, pth of his name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men.**
- pth of his name => he is the pth person in the ABC house to hold the name **XYZ**.
- For e.g John Snow will be called **Aegon** of the house Targaryen, 6th of his name. Because there have been 5 **Aegon** before him.

Because all the humans in **Westeros** are descendants of either the First Men, The Andals or The Rhoynar. Why?

**Past a certain point, all the dates grow hazy and confused, and the clarity of history becomes the fog of legend.**

## Age of Valyria

- While **Westeros** was recovering from the Long Night, in Essos, the peaceful sheep-herding folk of the **Valyrian peninsula find dragons.**
- The **Valyrians** tame the dragons with magic. Basically conquer everything including slaver's bay (from Old Ghis) in Essos. **-8000 AC to  -4700 AC**

### Invasion of Westeros by Andals (Steel Weapons): -4700 AC

- They first landed in the Fingers in the Vale of Arryn. From there, they spread all across **Westeros**.
- Followed Faith of the Seven called New Gods.
- They fought both the First Men and the children of the forest
- One by one, the six southern kingdoms fall and the weirwoods are burned. 
- Only the north remains under the rule of the First Men, in large part due to the strategically-located fortress of Moat Cailin.
- Old Gods were largely replaced by The Faith in the south.
- Moat Cailin held back the Andals from the north, however, so some children fled north.

### Rhoynar Migration to **Westeros**: -950 to -700 AC

- Following a prophetic dream of his daughter Daenys, Lord Aenar Targaryen (a nobleman) decides to leave Valyria with his family and all their belongings. They settle on Dragonstone in **Westeros**.

### The Doom of Valyria: -114 AC

- The nature of the Doom is unclear, save that heavy volcanic and seismic activity are involved, likely due to the Fourteen Flames, the mountains where the dragons were first discovered. 
- The Valyrian peninsula is shattered and the city of Valyria is laid waste, although not completely destroyed. 
- The dragons of Valyria are virtually wiped out and the Valyrian Freehold crumbles apart in the Century of Blood. 
- Its various city-states break apart, asserting their independence and surviving to this day as the Free Cities and the cities of Slaver's Bay.

# The Seven Kingdoms

- Over the centuries following the **Andal** invasion, the southern kingdoms of the First Men fall, and eventually the Andals raise up six powerful kingdoms of their own.
- **House Stark** finally subdues **House Bolton**, their primary antagonists for dominance in the North. 

- Later **Karlon Stark** would defeat sea raiders from the east and found the cadet branch **House Karstark**. In the west, the ironborn of the Iron Islands rise to power. This was alongside the Rohynar Migration.

## Targaryen Dynasty: 0-283 AC
