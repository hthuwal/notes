### Issac Newton (IN) vs Albert Einstein (AE)

#### **Drop an Apple:**

- **EN**
    + There is no such thing as Gravitational Force.
    + More appropriate to think apple as stationary.
    + Ground accelerating upward into the apple.

- **IN** (Are you mad Einstein?) :joy: 
    + Ground can be considered to be at rest.
    + Earth applies Gravitational Force to the Apple.
    + That force causes the apple to accelerate downwards.


#### **Frame of Reference**

- **IN**
    - x, y, z axes and clock to track time.
    - Inertial Frames:
        + Don't accelerate w.r.t each other.
        + Non accelerating frame.
        + Second Law is Valid. F = ma<sub>inertial frame</sub>.
        + How to check if you are in a Inertial Frame?
            * Take an object with no visible forces on it and let go of it.
            * If it stays put then the frame is not accelerating and is Inertial.
        + Pseudo Force in Non Inertial Frame.
        + [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mzDvpKzfY)
    - Inertial Frames decide true acceleration.

- **AE**: What if the so called downward gravity is fake. A Pseudo Force generated because Earth is just accelerating upward? :astonished:

- **IN**: Earth is really accelerating upward only if you can find a inertial frame relative to which earth is accelerating upwards. Can You Einstein?

- **AE** 
    - A freely falling frame. You Inside a lift dropped from a cliff :stuck_out_tongue:.
    - Everything floats. Everything stays put if no visible force acts on it.
    - So it must be inertial. And Earth is accelerating towards it.
    - If you are inside that box. There is no way for you to know that you are not in the intergalactic space (Inertial Frame).
    - I'll call this equivalence principal :grin:
        + Frame in Intergalactic space == Falling Frame
    - So Falling Frame is inertial, it decides true acceleration therefore ground is accelerating upwards and the apple is at rest.
    - We are on ground, an accelerated frame of reference therefore **Gravity is a Pseudo Force (An Illusion).** 

- **IN** :unamused:
    + Nice try Einstein, But you forgot something.
    + Earth is round. Down is radially inwards not vertically "downwards."
    + Two objects in a sufficiently large box falling towards the earth will move towards each other even in the frame of reference of the box. They won;t stay put. Therefore it can't be an inertial frame.
    + Also, from your argument Einstein, orbiting frame of reference are also inertial. But they are accelerating w.r.t to falling frame of reference. But inertial frames of reference can not accelerate w.r.t to each other.
    So, You're wrong. :smirk:

- **AE**  
    + No, that's where you're wrong
    + The **rule that inertial frames can't accelerate relative to each other is true if the world has flat geometry.**
    + But if the world is non euclidean and curved space-time, straight Lines and constant speed are not what you think they are and inertial Frame can do almost anything they want.
    + I say **we inhabit a curved space time** and in that space time
        * Orbit of ISS: Constant speed straight line.
        * Arc of a ball in air: Constant speed straight line.
        * But You sitting still: Are accelerating giving you an illusion that there is a force of gravity (pseudo force). 
    + :relieved:

- **IN**: Whaaaaatt!! :open_mouth:
- **AE**: I'll explain it later. :smirk:
