## 1. Are Space and Time An Illusion?

### Spacetime

Spacetime refers to whatever **external reality** underlies our collective experiences of the **space between things** and the **time between events.**

#### **Why** can't space-time be reality itself? Why add space-time as extra concept.

Because, two observers moving relative to each other may

1. Measure different time between events.
2. Measure different space between things.
3. Observe same set of events in different chronological order!!      

|Observer|Past|Present|Future|
|--------|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|Obs 1   |A   |   B   |  C   |
|Obs 2   |C   |   B   |  A   |

Each observer is measuring properly and is consistent.

This means -> **There is no universal division of events into past, present and future.**  

- Does this mean their is no free will?  
- Future is fixed can't be changed, because some observer has already experienced it?
- Is everyones experience of the universe subjective? Is time and space are not part of objective reality (That is universal truth, does not change with person to person)?

#### Then what is objective reality?

**Objective Reality**: Universal Agreement. All observer should agree about it.

All observers do agree on Spacetime Interval between two events.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(s.i.) = (Δx)<sup>2</sup> - (c.Δt)<sup>2</sup>**

Two observers in relative motion observing two events may observe:

- (Δx): (distances) differently
- (Δt): (elapsed time) differently

They'll always agree on the space time interval between the events. That is:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(s.i.) = (Δx<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - (c.Δt<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (Δx<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - (c.Δt<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>**

#### But what does the "Space Time Interval" Signify?

SpaceTime interval can be:

1. **+ve**: Nothing can get from one event to another. There exist observers who disagree on the chronological order of these events.
2. **0 or -ve**: Signals/things can go from one event to another. Everyone agrees on the chronological order.

So, space time interval between A and B denotes if A can influence B or not. **Causality**

We don't agree about past, present, future, time or distance but we all agree about causality!.....Whaaaaat?

But isn't time responsible for causality? No.

Causality is responsible for our temporal exprience.

**Causality is what is real.**

#### 4D space

- Space Time Interval Formula: "Sort of distance formula in a 4D non euclidean space."
- **Reality is not a 3D euclidean space that evolves in time but its a 4D non euclidean space that just exist. No evolution, no time.** Wooooh!!  
- This 4D non euclidean space is called **SpaceTime**
- Points in this space -> **Events** (all events, everywhere, everytime)
- Geometric relations between these points are objectively "real"
- e.g. Causal Relations -> correspond to a geometric relation **s.i.**, therefore real
- Our measurement of time and space don't correspond to anything.
    + They are like the x and y axis we draw on the paper(reality)
    + Useful for talking about paper (reality), but arbitary and inherently meaning less.
    + The paper(reality) (with all its geometric relations) is simply there, irrespective we put axis on it or not.

#### Am I objectively real?

- I am a continuous sequence of all events (where I was present)on the 4D space.
- I am a line segment (joining the events of my birth and death).
    + Birth ----------------------------- Death :P
- Do I move along this 4D non euclidean line segment?
    + No. I am the line segment. I am defined by this line segment.
    + There is no motion in the 4D space time. Its tenseless.
    + My future is not only predetermined. It already exist.
- I am a geometric relation in the 4D space.
- Therefore I am objetively real! Phew!!!

The 4D space disussed above is **flat space time.** There can be spacetime of various shapes. Curved!!!

#### So, Why do we perceive reality in this spatial and temporal way?

Don't Know.
