### [Intel Core i*?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLSPub4ydiM)

- Core i3 (Most Basic Option)
    + 2 Cores.
    + Hyper-threading.
    + Smaller Cache.
    + Less Power, Less Cost.
    + Generally performance is less than i5.
- Core i5
    + 2 Cores + Hyper-threading.
    + Or 4 Cores + No Hyper-threading.
    + Improved Onboard Graphics.
    + Turbo boost.
- Core i7
    + All core i7 have Hyper-threading for heavy workload.
    + 2 (Ultrabook) to 8 (Workstations) cores
    + 2-8 memory sticks
    + More cache, faster Turbo Boost, better Onboard graphics than lower tiered ones.

### [Hyper Threading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnS50lJicXc)

+ Core: Mouth, Multi-core: more mouths (Need Food)
+ Thread: Hands. Feed the mouth.
+ No time to waste. More number of hands might save time.
+ Beneficial only for multi-threaded workloads.
+ Slightly increases power consumption and heat output.

Hyper-Threading is better than No Hyper-Threading but is not nearly as good as adding more physical processors.

### [Turbo Boost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4ryOzIZvpQ)

- **Multiple Low power, Lower clocked cores** better than a single High Clocked, High Power core.
- Amp up the speed when needed?
- **Turbo Boost** redirects power from some cores to other sacrificing their performance to boost up others clock speed up to a limit for jobs that may not benefit from the multiple cores.
