#### Codecs

Algorithm to compress and decompress raw video files. 

- **H.264 (most popular)**: 
    + Same Quality at half the size of MPEG-2 (DVD & TV).
- **H.265 (new in town)**: 
    + AKA **HEVC**
    + More efficient than H.264
- But both are patent protected. Companies need to pay royalties before using them.
- VP8 and VP9 
    + Open source standards pushed by Google.
    + Arguably same Quality/Efficiency as HEVC. 
    + NetFlix uses VP9.
